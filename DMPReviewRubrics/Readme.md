This folder contains review rubrics for DMPs based on DMP templates included in DMPonline.be. 
A DMP review rubric is an evaluation grid that helps standardise the process of reviewing DMPs. 

The rubrics are inspired by and based on the example rubric (CC0) from the [DART project](https://Thisosf.io/26b9r/), which was presented during the IDCC 2016 DMP Workshop in Amsterdam on 25 February 2016.
